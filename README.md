# I. Introduction

## <p align="center">Linear Regression: *World Happiness Report*</p>

*<div align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Linear Regression* is a statistical analysis that is in common use in estimating the relationship between a one-dimensional dependent variable and the one or more independent variables. In the case of *World Happiness Report*, linear regression analysis can be of particular use to determine how economic production measured through Gross Domestic Product per Person – GDPPP, social support, health of a nation measured by life expectancy, freedom of an individual to make choices regarding his life, government credibility gauged by perceived corruption and citizens’ generosity are interrelated and affect the overall happiness of a certain country. Through the examination of these relations, it is possible to determine how much each factor adds to the level of happiness of subjects of this analysis and how much level of happiness is likely to be estimated at different future points in time on the basis of these factors.</div>

## II. Dataset Description
<div align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The datasets used for this analysis are from the World Happiness Reports spanning from 2015 to 2019. Each dataset includes several key variables that influence a country’s happiness score, including:</div>

- **Happiness Score:** The overall score that ranks the happiness level of each country based on survey data.

- **Economy (GDP per Capita):** A measure of the economic output per person in a country, used to assess the material well-being of citizens.

- **Family (Social Support):** The level of support available to individuals from family, friends, or social networks.

- **Health (Life Expectancy):** The expected lifespan of individuals in each country.

- **Freedom to Make Life Choices:** The degree of personal freedom individuals have in making life decisions.

- **Trust (Government Corruption):** The perceived level of corruption in a country’s government and institutions.

- **Generosity:** The amount of charitable donations and overall generosity within the population.

- **Dystopia Residual:** A hypothetical measure representing the worst possible scenario of a country in terms of these factors, used as a baseline for comparison.



## III. Project Objectives
